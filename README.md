# My_Spider
My first Spider

This is a simple spider project using Scrapy libraries.

The objective of this spider is to perform what I understand are the three key actiosn of a spider:
- Navigating the html code and selecting the right items/tags
- Downloading the flagged images
- Traversing throught links to continue scraping pages in the website
